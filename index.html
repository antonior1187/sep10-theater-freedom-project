                Microphones are a necessity if you want the actors to be heard by the audience. The first microphones were made in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell which only used electrical current and a wire. Two more people, Emile Berliner and Francis Blake, made microphones based on Alexander’s work by using steel and then carbon.

The thing is that since Drones are loud they can be picked up by microphones, so what I thought of is if the drone could make a very low frequency such as 10 hz, It could be used in so many ways that could revolutionize what is theater today.</h3>

              <h3>Microphones can be very obvious when you see them on shirts and costumes. While they are good for their intended performance, It can cause a distraction when someone else watches it. Especially now, People are watching actors many times and can see how stunts are done and how they can hear the actor but we shouldn’t be getting smaller with the microphone, we should get bigger. Let's say you had three mics, one backstage and two on the sides. They could be hidden easily and won’t be too noticeable. Those mics, called unidirectional mics, could be able to hear any kind of frequencies and from far away but only in one direction. That would clear most of the background noise. The audience meanwhile could produce a sound at the wrong time which could make the sound audio not usable so maybe having the back mic to be able to pick up sound from all sides could help limit the sound the audience makes. </h3>
